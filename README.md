## edx - Week 1 Challenge - Code Refactor for Horiseon

## Description

This was my first of many marked challenges as part of my engineering boot camp. We were tasked to refactor code based on semantic HTML and to add image "alt" attributes as it cleans the code and makes it more functional. The problem it solved is I refactored the code with semantics and img alts, and I used "navs" instead of "divs". I then altered the CSS accordingly. I learned that code can come in all sorts of manners, especially in HTML, and standard code practice isn't always the right way to go. Keeping things shorter and less cluttered can make or break a website. I also changed the colour of the website, as I thought it would stand out more by making their main colours mint green.
